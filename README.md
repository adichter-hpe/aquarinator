# Aquarinator

## Use-Case
With the help of this irrigation system, the plants can be watered automatically. So the user no longer has to worry that his plants are not sufficiently watered, because the irrigation is controlled by sensors. This also controls the aspect of targeted watering, because watering is only done when it is really necessary. In addition to this function, the user also has the option to view the data of his monitoring on a web app and can thus also perform some functions such as manual watering or measuring the humidity.
